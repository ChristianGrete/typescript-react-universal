# React TypeScript Universal

[![styled with prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled_with-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

This is a boilerplate for a Universal React App. Components and CSS are rendered both client and server side with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/) respectively. State is managed by [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and the async side effects are managed by [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) middleware. Code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and compiled with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

## Installation
